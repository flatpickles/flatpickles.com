Spouting truisms and narrating the crucifixion of personality<br>
I condemn the heretics from my unlikely castle<br>
Trading criticism for real news, adjusting to the outrage</p>
<p>The ocean burns softly and penguins light up their cigarettes<br>
Two packs a day, now that the doctors have all flown south<br>
The mountain goats sport suntans<br>
And perfect the art of the slip-and-slide</p>
<p>My world has dissolved into a parody of itself<br>
Talking behind itâ€™s own back and dissolving the fourth wall<br>
Asking:<br>
How long have you known?</p>`;
