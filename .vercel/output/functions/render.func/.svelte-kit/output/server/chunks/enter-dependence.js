both sustained and constrained by its structure<br>
I beat against its bars rhythmically<br>
while they beat back,<br>
and we each understand this to be a conversation.</p>

and existential containment imparts power,<br>
though not in the medieval sense:<br>
Without my heart I am powerless<br>
and without me, dear reader,<br>
so are you.</p>`;
