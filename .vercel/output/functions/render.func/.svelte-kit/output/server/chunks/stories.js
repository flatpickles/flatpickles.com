  return `<p>Marcella tries to convince her parents<br>
to let her spend more time in her Story Box.<br>
They acquiesce, only on the weekends.<br>
On mondays, she tells her classmates of<br>
adventures with knights and dragons.<br>
But here she is not a princess.<br>
They have stories too.</p>
<p>Maurice once got stuck in his Story Box.<br>
Hungry, he ate a purple mushroom<br>
and forgot where to find the Gate.</p>
<p>Prudence carries her Story Box with her<br>
even when she goes to school<br>
but is never brave enough to use it.<br>
For some reason,<br>
hers is filled with nightmares.</p>
<p>Domingo wishes he had a dog<br>
in the Real World.</p>
<p>Trinity’s Story Box is made of leather<br>
and would be plain but for the portraits she<br>
paints on its sides.<br>
They are mostly aliens,<br>
mostly aliens she has met.</p>
<p>Louis doesn’t care for his Story Box.<br>
It’s once shiny steel exterior now rusts<br>
neglected for months at a time.<br>
Louis prefers the Outside.</p>
<p>Felix’s Story Box sits amongst some weeds<br>
alone<br>
in his backyard.<br>
He hasn’t been seen in two years.</p>
<p>Annabel doesn’t have a Story Box.<br>
It’s not that her parents<br>
can’t afford it.<br>
They just worry about the side effects.</p>
<p>Jessica cannot sleep<br>
concerned<br>
about monsters<br>
under her bed.<br>
But in her Story Box<br>
she has guards to protect her.<br>
She does most of her sleeping<br>
there.</p>
<p>Sam worries that someday he will<br>
outgrow his Story Box; he worries that<br>
he has sailed all his seas.<br>
His parents reassure him:<br>
there are always more seas<br>
even for us.<br>
You just have to find them.</p>`;
