etc.</p>
<p>One can optimize their life to maximize income and thereby increase their disposable cashflow, but one can also strive to be economical within lesser means, and thereby assemble more of a feeling of financial freedom. This is possible with time, too. While I may not want to quit my 50-hr/wk job, I can be careful and intentional about how I spend my hours outside of work, and reclaim a greater feeling of liberty.</p>`;
