  return `<p>I.</p>
<p>Wayne rides his motorbike on lawns<br>
leaving deep furrows<br>
half-pipes for ants and earthworms<br>
an unrecognized hero<br>
parting the seas of green.</p>
<p>Mud speckles Wayne’s letterman jacket<br>
but he’s not concerned.<br>
The rain will wash it clean<br>
soon enough.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>As a child, Wayne disliked shoes.<br>
His parents were informed that<br>
all children must wear shoes to school.<br>
They tied his laces every morning<br>
despite his objections.</p>
<p>Wayne ties his own laces now.<br>
He has no choice in the matter<br>
but doesn’t really mind.</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>Where are you going?<br>
Wayne doesn’t know, shrugs.<br>
Well, this wing is restricted. Did you know that?<br>
Yes. Maybe. Doubtful, actually.<br>
Move along then.<br>
Gladly. I already have what I came for.</p>
<p>Wayne leaves the museum with his ticket stub<br>
and the hint of a smile.</p>
<p>IV.</p>
<p>Working night shifts<br>
Wayne is the only person alive.<br>
His mind drifts south<br>
past the border.</p>
<p>It is summer here. Flowers bloom<br>
people are dancing.<br>
Wayne hates the wind, but<br>
this wind is warm and carries him<br>
into loving arms.</p>
<p>She welcomes him into<br>
her home and her bed<br>
baking him cupcakes<br>
and telling him stories<br>
in language he does not understand.</p>
<p>V.</p>
<p>Sometimes, Wayne swims in the ocean<br>
early in the morning.</p>
<p>He heard once that comfort is<br>
the first sign of hypothermia.<br>
When chill pain becomes numbness<br>
and numbness becomes tranquility<br>
Wayne moves on.</p>
<p>VI.</p>
<p>Wayne is running for the bus<br>
but the driver doesn’t see.<br>
Wayne keeps running<br>
anyway.</p>
<p>He runs through streets and<br>
alleyways and backyards and<br>
swimming pools and forests<br>
and when daylight comes<br>
he can see the wounds.</p>
<p>VII.</p>
<p>The doctor said that maybe<br>
if Wayne tried a little harder<br>
he would stop bleeding.  </p>
<p>Wayne doubts this is true<br>
but agrees<br>
he’s not really trying.</p>`;
