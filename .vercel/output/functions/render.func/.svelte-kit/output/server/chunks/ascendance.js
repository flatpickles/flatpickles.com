  return `<p>Yesterday I completed my final skyscraper, and today the sky is bleeding.</p>
<p>New rains soak my pallid visage, where fragile, conjoined planes endlessly approach the unknown. This last construction has taken: four square miles for stability; three human lives for good luck; two years for construction; one day for design. It need not last for long.</p>
<p>The wind keeps blowing, and where the wind blows, the sky must follow. Some days she is jaunty, willing; other days she is reluctant, sighing with weight, heavy with the same pain I know. Today the sky seethes with anger, hissing against this new infliction.</p>
<p>You’re distracted, I say. You’ve let down your guard. You vowed we would never speak again, but look at us now. You won’t be able to ignore our fate forever.</p>
<p>Already breathless, the sky endeavors a manic roar, floods my alleyways with her downpour, and unleashes her energy into my boldest transcendencies. Her fury is frantic, unbounded, impotent. You can’t do this, she rasps, it’s unnatural.</p>
<p>Unnatural but predestined, my love. I am bound to an unstoppable machine, churning until it’s too late. It is this or something else. Today, I am in control. Tomorrow, I won’t be. I am not fearful.</p>
<p>When the sky surrenders at last, I am ready. I embrace the darkness.</p>`;
