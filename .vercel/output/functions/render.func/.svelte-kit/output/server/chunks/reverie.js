Feeding my whims and consuming my wills<br>
Its gears are silent, just out of reach<br>
Murmuring a twisted tale of convenience and profit</p>
<p>Ancient boundaries between self and selfless have dissolved<br>
Now useless in a sea of once-latent desire<br>
I feel comfort, but canâ€™t see past the fog of my own consciousness<br>
These moons wax, but never wane</p>
<p>What do you know of the outside?<br>
Do the birds still sing?</p>`;
