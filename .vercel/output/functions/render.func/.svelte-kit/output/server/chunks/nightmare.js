splitting reality at its seems, replacing apparent likeness with un-likeliness<br>
sewing together needs and wants with threads of my own flesh<br>
craving completion but finding component parts in unexpected places:<br>
my right hand is sending me texts from last night and<br>
my left hand is in the hamburger I ate for lunch and<br>
my great-grandmother poses seductively at the helm of a sinking ship</p>
<p>a tree falls (silently) while its peers look on (lasciviously) while<br>
Jay Z’s holy mouth drips blood on my new white sofa<br>
and your eyes read this line more slowly than the rest<br>
blinking with the sudden realization that a soul’s windows peer both ways</p>
<p>indeed, other souls’ windows surround me, and thus I am exposed:<br>
a pale épistème laid bare and defenseless<br>
slowly, deliberately eviscerated, picked over for my juiciest morsels<br>
then haphazardly reassembled, mortarless, unwhole, greater than my sum but<br>
only as evaluated by experts in the field</p>
<p>and, at the end of the day, who am I to resist.</p>`;
