Cycles
-------

Waves arc shoreward
Sand and foam and entropy
Dispensing a starâ€™s energy
Building careers, homes, families
A sense of self

Waves dream of the infinite
But know not of the beach
The quick crash, head over heels
A return whence came

Reassembly then
Even more of a surprise
Fragments slowly collecting
Individuality gradually forming

And again
Waves arc shoreward
