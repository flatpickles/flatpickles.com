        <p>
            This is a demo note that I'm putting in here, just to see how it feels.
            It's still going! It's gonna keep going for a minute, while we make sure that it feels good.
            How was your day? While we're here, I'd love to hear about it. Oh wait, apologies, that's time.
            See you next week!
        </p>
