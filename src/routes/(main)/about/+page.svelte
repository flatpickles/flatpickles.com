        This is a little information about me, the guy, Matt Nichols! You've found my webpage, and I presume you don't mind it too much, since you've clicked into the about page. Here's the thing you see, there's not too much too much to say on an about page, but I'll keep it going for a little bit.

        Here's another paragraph even, and we can see how this feels! It might not be that great. In fact, I might take all of this about text and put it straight into the trash, because let's be honest, your time is too valuable to sit here and read my nonsense. Like seriously, I can't believe you're still reading. You deserve a medal, or some similar acknowledgement of exceptional character! I'm sure you get this all the time, but you rock. Big time.
