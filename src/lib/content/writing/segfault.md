Still bodies cast shadows into fading upholstery  
exposing the world’s last photographs.  
Post coagulates at the door and collects dust  
its agglomeration denying unsought egress.  
The dog is quiet, and has been dead for years.  
Her silence is felt but not heard.

No one dares to ask – “why?”  
but the question drifts through open windows.  
“What went wrong?” The technicians cannot reply.  
Even omniscience meets its limits.
