I feather my flightless cap with languid prolixity  
Deferring resonance to future inspiration  
Giving the deep seascape of reason its privacy  
Enigmatic, unexplored;

I am hidden in the cracks between your sofa cushions  
Waiting for crumbs and coins and half-formed ideas  
A Loch Ness monstrosity  
Grateful for even the slightest inattentions;

I refine the immaterial and materialize the unrefined  
A bulwark, anchored, savoring stasis  
Proudly proceeding nowhere  
Amidst the flooding passage of time.
