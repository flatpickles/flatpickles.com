The tables have turned again and again  
and again I, a tireless adversary  
stare deep into my own reflection  

He smiles softly, eyebrows drifting upwards,  
poorly concealing some clever protuberance  
a new trick up the sleeve of his faded blue blazer

We each seek control of our counterpart,  
at least: prevalence in atavistic contention  
at best: victory of self over selfless

Despite our coextensive confidence,  
I alone can shift our paradigm  
and I now embrace my upper ground:  
this game is mine to lose  
and in knowing this, I have won.
