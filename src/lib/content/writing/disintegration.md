The waves of time lap at your cranial isle  
carving creases into grey matter  
carrying away the detritus of yesteryear

On some foreign shore, this loose material collects  
forming sandy beaches  
membered by rememberings  
passed by passersby

Someday you will pass by yourself, after passing over  
still the same self you've known  
but now in so many pieces  
you might as well be everything

In the meantime, reach out and pick up this poem:  
a message in a bottle, scribbled whence it came

And why did it end like that?
