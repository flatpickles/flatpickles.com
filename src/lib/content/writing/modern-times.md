As the TV gets louder so too does my internal monologue  
Spouting truisms and narrating the crucifixion of personality  
I condemn the heretics from my unlikely castle  
Trading criticism for real news, adjusting to the outrage

The ocean burns softly and penguins light up their cigarettes  
Two packs a day, now that the doctors have all flown south  
The mountain goats sport suntans  
And perfect the art of the slip-and-slide

My world has dissolved into a parody of itself  
Talking behind it's own back and dissolving the fourth wall  
Asking:  
How long have you known?
