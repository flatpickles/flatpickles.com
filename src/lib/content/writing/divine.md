Who's to say that these are your thoughts  
and not the thoughts of friendly insects  
folded into your gray matter, nestled  
between your first kiss and your tendency  
to mouthbreathe while reading

This ethereal imbrication across your  
surface of being is not yours nor you,  
but merely symptomatic of some deeper  
abstraction
