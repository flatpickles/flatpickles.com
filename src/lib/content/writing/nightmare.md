my restless mind entangles meaning without attention to detail  
splitting reality at its seems, replacing apparent likeness with un-likeliness  
sewing together needs and wants with threads of my own flesh  
craving completion but finding component parts in unexpected places:  
my right hand is sending me texts from last night and  
my left hand is in the hamburger I ate for lunch and  
my great-grandmother poses seductively at the helm of a sinking ship

a tree falls (silently) while its peers look on (lasciviously) while  
Jay Z’s holy mouth drips blood on my new white sofa  
and your eyes read this line more slowly than the rest  
blinking with the sudden realization that a soul’s windows peer both ways

indeed, other souls’ windows surround me, and thus I am exposed:  
a pale épistème laid bare and defenseless  
slowly, deliberately eviscerated, picked over for my juiciest morsels  
then haphazardly reassembled, mortarless, unwhole, greater than my sum but  
only as evaluated by experts in the field

and, at the end of the day, who am I to resist.
