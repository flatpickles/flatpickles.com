I am a being entwined  
amidst ungrounded thoughts  
still moving  
still quiet in the broken glass  

Footsteps flow beneath my path  
while the breeze blows on  
slowly, steadily  
without concern

Lest I trip I keep rising  
high above forethought  
well beyond reason  
into the infinite expanse

Onward.
