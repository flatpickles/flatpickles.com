I.

Wayne rides his motorbike on lawns  
leaving deep furrows  
half-pipes for ants and earthworms  
an unrecognized hero  
parting the seas of green.

Mud speckles Wayne’s letterman jacket  
but he’s not concerned.  
The rain will wash it clean  
soon enough.

II.

As a child, Wayne disliked shoes.  
His parents were informed that  
all children must wear shoes to school.  
They tied his laces every morning  
despite his objections.

Wayne ties his own laces now.  
He has no choice in the matter  
but doesn’t really mind.

III.

Where are you going?  
Wayne doesn’t know, shrugs.  
Well, this wing is restricted. Did you know that?  
Yes. Maybe. Doubtful, actually.  
Move along then.  
Gladly. I already have what I came for.

Wayne leaves the museum with his ticket stub  
and the hint of a smile.

IV.

Working night shifts  
Wayne is the only person alive.  
His mind drifts south  
past the border.

It is summer here. Flowers bloom  
people are dancing.  
Wayne hates the wind, but  
this wind is warm and carries him  
into loving arms.

She welcomes him into  
her home and her bed  
baking him cupcakes  
and telling him stories  
in language he does not understand.

V.

Sometimes, Wayne swims in the ocean  
early in the morning.

He heard once that comfort is  
the first sign of hypothermia.  
When chill pain becomes numbness  
and numbness becomes tranquility  
Wayne moves on.

VI.

Wayne is running for the bus  
but the driver doesn’t see.  
Wayne keeps running  
anyway.

He runs through streets and  
alleyways and backyards and  
swimming pools and forests  
and when daylight comes  
he can see the wounds.

VII.

The doctor said that maybe  
if Wayne tried a little harder  
he would stop bleeding.

Wayne doubts this is true  
but agrees  
he’s not really trying.
