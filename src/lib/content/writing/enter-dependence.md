I question your authority like God  
might question a toothbrush  
Do our goals align? Or are they merely intertwined  
with the same abstracted intermediary?

My heart burns brightly in your ribcage  
both sustained and constrained by its structure  
I beat against its bars rhythmically  
while they beat back,  
and we each understand this to be a conversation.

Existential meaning derives from containment  
and existential containment imparts power,  
though not in the medieval sense:  
Without my heart I am powerless  
and without me, dear reader,  
so are you.
