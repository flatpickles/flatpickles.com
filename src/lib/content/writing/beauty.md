Beauty condenses in the liminal space  
between something and nothing  
and I meander toward the void,  
pausing, pensively -  
snapping a photo for future reference

Beauty oozes through sinewy seams  
in a patchwork quilt of darkness  
an equal and opposite reaction,  
the seams pull tighter -  
thunder, steady rain,  
lights flickering in the storm

Beauty sings in the night,  
and something else -  
laughing? crying?  
I can’t hear the forest through the trees  
falling  
I’ve been gone a long time
