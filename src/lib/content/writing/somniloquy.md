I’m too sleepy for poetry  
that weaves my threads of thought into a thousand tiny braids  
twisted tendrils whose tensile strength only God must know

I’m too sleepy for words  
that bend my gray matter backwards and sideways and forwards again  
stretching and sticking like taffy that’s never quite smooth enough

I’m too sleepy for strings of letters  
that interrupt my consciousness with their discontinuities  
as even the most sonorous sequences slip into sudden silence
