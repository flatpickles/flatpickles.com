I’m a solipsist on a silly quest  
to question the grounds on which we met  
You’re in my mind, and I in yours  
voracious ontological omnivores.

My subtle sands are mixed and mingled  
amidst Pringle cans and deadly shingles  
Myriad selves as shelves abound,  
collecting dust and losing ground  
All are real and all are fake,  
each purpose built as a garden rake

But what slips amidst my careful tines?  
Just time and rhymes and forgotten lines.
