A nameless machine churns around me  
Feeding my whims and consuming my wills  
Its gears are silent, just out of reach  
Murmuring a twisted tale of convenience and profit

Ancient boundaries between self and selfless have dissolved  
Now useless in a sea of once-latent desire  
I feel comfort, but canâ€™t see past the fog of my own consciousness  
These moons wax, but never wane

What do you know of the outside?  
Do the birds still sing?
