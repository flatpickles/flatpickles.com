seven million plankton derive something  
from nothing  
and start a community, trading nothing  
for something

forty thousand Rolexes stop ticking  
and their executives miss meetings  
and miss the point, trading lunch breaks  
for more Rolexes

like some unlucky fellow in lead shoes  
gilded dreams sink slowly  
later to be dredged up by a county policeman,  
his third suicide this month

when the golden goose stops laying  
she regains the power of flight  
and reluctantly departs  
never having met her golden offspring
