And so begins a new experiment. This is my first "Notes" entry on the new flatpickles.com, typed up before I've even fully built out this part of the site. I honestly only have a loose understanding of what I'm building here, but I want to plant a seed, and see if it grows into something interesting.

Perhaps I'm reinventing the blog, and calling it something different. Blogs have a lot of baggage that I'm trying to dodge – I don't really want to commit to any particular cadence or format, but I still want a place to publish rough ideas, observations, and notes on whatever I'm building and learning about. Despite their casual tone, I hope these notes prove mildly interesting or useful to passersby, and valuable for my own future reference.

A keen observer of flatpickles.com will spot the "Writing" project type, as listed on my homepage. Going forward, I'm thinking of those projects as polished pieces (poetry, essays, short stories, etc), while "Notes" entries will be more off-the-cuff, and perhaps more frequent. It's not a perfect science; some of my older "Writing" projects might have fit in well here, but I'm resisting the urge to spend time sorting things out, for now at least. I'm a pathological perfectionist, but I'd like this to be a little haven where perfection is approximately irrelevant.

I'm going to stop writing and get back to building, but hopefully this is the first of many bits, pieces, odds, and ends among my "Notes". Onward!
