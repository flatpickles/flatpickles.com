These beautiful months keep unfolding, and it’s an honor to bear witness.

My past year and half has been a series of liminal spaces – bouncing back from burnout, an artistic deep dive, startup dreams come & gone – and most recently a focused drive toward the next chapter of my career. Interwoven throughout it all are my people, the friends and family I hold dear, supporting me and lighting the way. Love and gratitude always.

This moment is a transition between eras, in my life and in the world at large. I’m embracing a holographic perspective: as above so below, each part containing the whole. We are all breathing together.

Tomorrow is my first day at OpenAI. I’m so excited to climb some new learning curves, and contribute to a much brighter future. Onward! ✨
