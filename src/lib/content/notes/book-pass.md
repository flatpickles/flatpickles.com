I’ve been holding myself to a new rule: I don’t recommend a book until I’ve read more than half of it. Life is short, and even though I can easily get excited about new experiences, I try to transition with grace and humility when these experiences are no longer giving me energy. Since I don’t always finish the books I start, I’d rather only recommend the ones I’m likely to finish.

Once I do finish a book worth recommending, I want to actively find the next person who it can resonate with, and pass it along to them. Lately I’ve been encouraging folks to continue this practice: if you read and appreciate a book I’ve given you, please pass it on to someone else! And if you don’t read it, or don’t like it, please pass it back to me, and I’ll try sharing it with someone else. Before you pass it forward, write your name in the book, so it slowly collects a list of past owners who found it worth sharing.

For better or worse, my maker’s mind has engaged with this idea, and I’ve been pondering ways to ever-so-slightly formalize it. Perhaps this idea could proliferate as a format for actively sharing ideas and stories with each other.

I’m planning to design and print stickers with a pithy description of this practice, and perhaps a link to a website with more of an explanation; [bookpass.org](http://bookpass.org) currently redirects here. I’ll distribute these stickers to my people, and make them available online. We can put the stickers in the books we love, and start writing our names next to them.

Importantly, I want this process to remain as lightweight as possible. [BookCrossing](https://www.bookcrossing.com/) and other similar projects are wonderful, but much less intimate. We don’t need a centralized account of a book’s travels, nor do we need to share books opportunistically with anyone who _might_ appreciate them. I’d like for us to stay focused on deep intentionality, and thoughtful human connection.

It’s quite possible that this idea will never exit my circle of friends, but I still think it’s cool. If you also think it’s cool, maybe tell someone about it, or [let me know](https://x.com/flatpickles/status/1811849097948922361)!

I’ll post an update here if/when I design those stickers, but you might as well pass a book to someone in the meantime. Maybe they’ll read it, love it, and pass it forward.
