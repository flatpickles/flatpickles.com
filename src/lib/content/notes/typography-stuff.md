I've been unusually enthusiastic about typography lately, and I keep coming across resources worth saving. To that end, I'll start collecting those resources here, and I'll bump this note up to the top of my Notes page if/when I update it.

**Favorite foundries:**

-   [OH no Type Company](https://ohnotype.co/). The first fonts I ever bought were their [collabs](https://ohnotype.co/fonts/vulf) with Vulfpeck (used here). Check out [Ohno Radio](https://ohno-radio.simplecast.com/) too, if you're into this stuff.
-   [Nuform Type](https://nuformtype.com/). Their gorgeous website is enough to make me fall in love, and the fonts are pretty rad too.
-   [David Jonathan Ross](https://djr.com/). These fonts make me want to publish a zine. His "Font of the Month" club looks great too.

** Typefaces of note:**

-   [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/). Perhaps the most readable typeface I've ever read. Free, open source, and fully featured with extra sauce.
-   [ET Book](https://edwardtufte.github.io/et-book/). Just the right balance of academic & vibey, like the rest of Edward Tufte's [work](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi). Fits well within [Tufte CSS](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/).
-   [Pragmata Pro](https://fsd.it/shop/fonts/pragmatapro/). Some of the smartest coders I know use this one (hi Dan).

**Font libraries:**

-   [Fontshare](https://www.fontshare.com/). 100+ beautiful pro-grade typefaces, all free to use. Their "pairs" of display & text types are great too.
-   [Variable Fonts](https://v-fonts.com/). An index of variable fonts (some free, some paid) with inline variable sliders. And you know how much I love sliders!
-   [Open Foundry](https://open-foundry.com/fonts). Lots of beautiful and/or utilitarian fonts, all open source, and presented VERY large so you know they're legit.
-   [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). It's been 28 years since anyone navigated the Google Fonts UX without losing hair, but it's still a great resource.

**Developer resources:**

-   [Font Squirrel Webfont Generator](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator). Indispensible tool for optimizing and normalizing type for the web. Fix vertical metrics, convert file types, etc.
-   [opentype.js](https://opentype.js.org/). Access letterform vector data, modify shapes, and render text in creative ways.
-   [Modern Font Stacks](https://modernfontstacks.com/). System fonts for every modern OS, organized by typeface classification.

**Reading materials:**

-   [Font vs typeface](https://www.creativebloq.com/features/font-vs-typeface). These terms mean different things, but are often interchangeable. I've probably messed it up somewhere in here though.
-   [A rant on web font licenses](https://manuelmoreale.com/a-rant-on-web-font-licenses). I love it that type designers get paid, but navigating font licensing can be hairy for devs. Worth [considering](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35095393).
