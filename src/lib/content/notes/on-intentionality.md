title: On Intentionality

In my very personal approach to personal growth, I observe the gospel of intentionality: by pursuing carefully curated intentions, I organically grow into alignment with my evolving values, and avoid getting distracted by top-down, aspirational architectures of self. I find that this approach also presents a salve for imposter syndrome and self-consciousness, in that it facilitates self-love regardless of any external absolutes. I will never be "complete", and any of my works are mere footsteps along the journey. As long as I'm walking in the right direction, I can find contentment.
