**Hello world, it's me, Matt!** I'm a software engineer and creative coder, living and working in San Francisco. After graduating from Brown CS about a decade ago, I've worked on engineering and creative teams at Twitter, [Eyegroove](https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/05/facebook-snatches-up-team-from-eyegroove-a-musical-selfie-app/), and Facebook/Meta. I'm now a cofounder of [Good Wording](https://goodword.ing), where we're hard at work building an AI-powered tool for writing & thinking.

In both my professional work and in my personal life, **I am driven by curiosity.** I love figuring out how complex things fit together, especially when I can distill any underlying principles to further my own creative potential. There are so many things I have yet to learn, but I wouldn’t want it any other way!

Much like its author, **this website is an eternal work in progress.** I’d like it to be my internet living room: a vibey space decorated with things I’m proud of and fascinated by, a comfy spot for others to hang out, and a place I can call home. I'm honored that you've chosen to spend some time here with me – thanks so much for visiting!

If you want to get in touch, **I'd love to hear from you.** You can follow any of my links from the top of this page, or [send me an email](mailto:matt@flatpickles.com).
