**Hello world, it's me, Matt!** I'm a software engineer and creative coder, living and working in San Francisco. Over my decade-long career, I've worked for a few companies you've heard of and at least one you haven't, generally striving to create things that make the world a more fun and friendly place. Most recently, I've been working in a hybrid design/eng role on the Sound Design team at Meta, building interactive multimedia experiences with a particular focus on audio.

In both my day job and my personal life, **I am driven by curiosity.** I love figuring out how complex things fit together, especially when I can distill any underlying principles, and apply them to further my own creative potential. It's such a blessing to be exploring new territory in both my career and in my hobbies, and I'm excited to be deepening my technical and creative skills along the way. There are so many things I have yet to learn, but I wouldn’t want it any other way!

**Much like its author, this website is a work in progress.** I primarily intend for it to be a published archive of my thoughts and creations, though having an audience here (be it real or imagined) also brings structure to the things I’m working on. I’d like [flatpickles.com](https://flatpickles.com) to be my internet living room: a vibey space decorated with things I’m proud of and fascinated by, a comfy spot for others to hang out, and a place I can call home. I'm honored that you've chosen to spend some time here with me – thanks so much for visiting!

If you want to get in touch, **I'd love to hear from you.** You can follow any of my links from the [top](#) of this page, or you can [send me an email](mailto:matt@flatpickles.com).
