**Hello world, it’s me, Matt!** I’m an engineer, artist, creative technologist, musician, San Franciscan, dog dad, and lots of other things. After graduating from Brown CS in 2013, I’ve worked on engineering and creative teams at Twitter, [Eyegroove](https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/05/facebook-snatches-up-team-from-eyegroove-a-musical-selfie-app/), Facebook/Meta, and [Good Wording](https://goodword.ing). I’m currently pursuing free-range projects and contract work, and I’d be glad to chat about any interesting opportunities in your orbit.

My **life philosophy** boils down to a few big ideas: creating things is fun, fun is essential, and essentially anything is possible through human connection. Challenges abound, but we can move mountains with positivity, authenticity, courage, and good humor. Channeling creative energy into our world is an incredible privilege, and it's so cool that we get to do that together.

Much like its author, **this website is an eternal work in progress.** I'd like it to be my internet living room: a vibey space decorated with things I’m proud of and fascinated by, a comfy spot for others to hang out, and a place I can call home. I’m honored that you’ve chosen to spend some time here with me – thanks so much for visiting.

If you want to talk about work, life, or anything, **it’d be awesome to hear from you.** You can follow any of my links from the top of this page, or [send me an email](mailto:matt@flatpickles.com). Much love always.
